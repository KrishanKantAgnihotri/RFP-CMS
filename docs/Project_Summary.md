# RFP Contract Management System - Project Summary

## Project Overview

The RFP Contract Management System is a full-stack application designed to streamline the Request for Proposal (RFP) process between buyers and suppliers. The system allows buyers to create, publish, and manage RFPs, while suppliers can browse available RFPs and submit responses. The application includes comprehensive user management, document handling, notifications, and role-based access control.
