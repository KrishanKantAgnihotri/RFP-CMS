# AI Usage Report

## Overview

In this project, AI-powered tools such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot were used to assist with documentation, error resolution, and generating boilerplate code. The use of these tools was kept within 20% of the overall project effort to ensure that the majority of the work remained original and developer-driven.

## Areas Where AI Was Used

- **Documentation:**
  - Drafting and refining README files, setup guides, and API documentation.
  - Example: Generating a first draft of the Quick Start Guide, which was then reviewed and edited by the developer.

- **Error Resolution:**
  - Getting suggestions for fixing common coding errors and debugging issues.
  - Example: Using ChatGPT to resolve a FastAPI CORS configuration error that blocked frontend-backend communication.

- **Boilerplate Code Generation:**
  - Creating initial templates for API endpoints, React components, and configuration files.
  - Example: Using Copilot to scaffold a new FastAPI endpoint for document uploads, which was then customized for project needs.

## AI Usage Estimate

The combined use of AI tools for the above purposes accounted for approximately 20% of the total project effort. All critical business logic, security-sensitive code, and final documentation were reviewed and written by the developer.

## Notes

AI tools were used as productivity aids, not as replacements for original development. All code and documentation generated with AI assistance was carefully reviewed and adapted to fit the specific requirements of the project.
